# YouTube Trimmer (w/ FFMPEG)
This is a public GitHub repository of my personal project, YouTube Trimmer.

## Motive
There were funny memes that I want to clip on YouTube, but I don't have time to download bazillion gigabytes of YouTube video file, opening my Premiere Pro just trim these out. It's wasting time, and my hard drive. <br/>

I also found that developers also made this before, but it's not user-friendly, somes are unmaintained, confusing, somes going through the CLI/command line; and I really have no energy to do like the installation and stuff like that.

## Dependencies
I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev) for the website, and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for the video processing. <br />
For the server-side, please visit this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ray-1337/youtube-trimmer-ffmpeg-server).

## Trimmed Video Aftermath
The trimmed video will be uploaded to the cloud storage. In my case, for flexible reason, I use [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net?ref=59m0uotfa1).
